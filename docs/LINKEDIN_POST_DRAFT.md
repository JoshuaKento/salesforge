# LinkedIn Post Draft: SalesForge CRM Launch

---

## 🚀 **Main Post**

**Just shipped a full-stack CRM in 2 days using Claude Code! 🎯**

I'm excited to share **SalesForge** - a modern Sales Force Automation platform I built to showcase what's possible when AI-assisted development meets solid engineering principles.

🔥 **What I built:**
✅ Spring Boot 3 REST API with JWT authentication
✅ React 18 + TypeScript responsive frontend  
✅ PostgreSQL with Flyway migrations
✅ 90%+ test coverage with integration tests
✅ Production deployment on Render
✅ Complete API documentation with Swagger

🛠️ **Technical highlights:**
• Multi-module Spring Boot architecture (core/security/web/infra)
• Role-based access control (ADMIN/MANAGER/SALES_REP)
• Advanced search & filtering with real-time updates
• Docker containerization & CI/CD ready
• Mobile-first responsive design
• Comprehensive health checks & monitoring

🎪 **Features delivered:**
• Lead management with full CRUD operations
• Advanced filtering and search capabilities
• User authentication and role management
• Real-time data updates
• Production-ready deployment
